# JAVASCRIPT BRUTEFORCES
The RF bruteforce can open stuff aka if you go near a device or something that uses RF signals to open it can be opened with it. It sends everytime a different signal and activates.
IR bruteforce is then it also spams random signals until it opens or turns on for example your tv or switch channels in your tv.

HOPE YOU ENJOY THOSE AMAZING PROGRAMMING STUFF I MAKE!
